# Database Seeder

This directory contains database seeding scripts to populate your MongoDB database with initial data.

## Files

- `adminSeeder.js` - Seeds admin users, levels, and game state configuration

## Usage

### Run the Seeder

```bash
# From the backend directory
npm run seed

# Or directly with node
node src/seeders/adminSeeder.js
```

### What Gets Seeded

#### ðŸ‘¥ Admin Users
- **Super Admin**: `admin` / `admin123`
- **Moderator**: `moderator` / `mod123`  
- **Judge**: `judge` / `judge123`

#### ðŸŽ¯ Sample Levels
1. **Urban Architecture** (Easy - 100 points)
2. **Nature in the City** (Medium - 150 points)
3. **Street Art & Culture** (Hard - 200 points)
4. **Final Challenge: Creative Composition** (Expert - 500 points)

#### ðŸŽ® Game State
- Initial game configuration
- Registration open
- Game status: waiting

## Prerequisites

1. **MongoDB running** on your system
2. **Environment variables** set up (see `.env.example`)
3. **Dependencies installed** (`npm install`)

## Environment Variables

Make sure you have these in your `.env` file:

```env
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/photo-marathon
JWT_SECRET=your-secret-key
```

## Safety Features

- **Duplicate Prevention**: Won't create duplicate admin users or levels
- **Safe to Re-run**: Can be executed multiple times safely
- **Password Hashing**: All passwords are properly hashed with bcrypt

## Customization

You can modify the seeder data by editing:

- `adminUsers` array for different admin accounts
- `sampleLevels` array for custom level configurations
- `gameStateConfig` for different game settings

## Troubleshooting

### Connection Issues
- Ensure MongoDB is running
- Check your connection string in `.env`
- Verify network connectivity

### Permission Issues
- Make sure the seeder has write access to your database
- Check if your MongoDB user has the right permissions

### Model Errors
- Ensure all required models are properly defined
- Check for any schema validation errors
